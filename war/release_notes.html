<h1>Release Notes</h1>
<h2>Version 0.1, 29 Jan 2014</h2>
<p>First release. I wrote a blog post about this at
<a href="http://jdesbonnet.blogspot.ie/2014/02/a-fine-stretch-in-evenings.html">http://jdesbonnet.blogspot.ie/2014/02/a-fine-stretch-in-evenings.html</a>.
 
The source code is available at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jdesbonnet/a-fine-stretch-in-the-evenings">https://github.com/jdesbonnet/a-fine-stretch-in-the-evenings</a>
</p>

<p>
Known problems:
</p>

<ul>

<li> uses timezonedb.com web API to deduce local timezone form latitude,longitude. This may take a few seconds 
and may on fail on occasion. I'm looking for a good alternative that doesn't involve an external web API.
</li>

<li> If the local timezone cannot be deduced, will default to UTC which will cause chart rendering problems for
zones far from the 0 meridian.
</li>

<li> Because of the two items above, rendering charts near the poles is problematic.</li>

</ul>
