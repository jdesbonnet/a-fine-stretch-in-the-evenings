<h1>A Fine Stretch in the Evenings, Release Notes</h1>

<h2>Version 0.1.1 3 Feb 2014</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove obsolete CSS rules.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.1, 29 Jan 2014</h2>

<p>First release. I wrote a blog post about this at
<a href="http://jdesbonnet.blogspot.ie/2014/02/a-fine-stretch-in-evenings.html">http://jdesbonnet.blogspot.ie/2014/02/a-fine-stretch-in-evenings.html</a>.
</p>

<p> It makes extensive use of SVG (part the the HTML5 spec) so it certainly won't work with old browsers.
It has been tested with the latest (at time of release) Google Chrome and Firefox. From experience
it probably won't work with Internet Explorer (I don't have a copy handy to test right now).
</p>

<p>
The source code is available at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jdesbonnet/a-fine-stretch-in-the-evenings">https://github.com/jdesbonnet/a-fine-stretch-in-the-evenings</a>
</p>

<p>
Known problems:
</p>

<ul>

<li> uses timezonedb.com web API to deduce local timezone from latitude,longitude. This may take a few seconds 
and may on fail on occasion. I'm looking for a good alternative that doesn't involve an external web API.
</li>

<li> If the local timezone cannot be deduced, will default to UTC which will cause chart rendering problems for
zones far from the 0 meridian.
</li>

<li> Because of the two items above, rendering charts near the poles is problematic.</li>

<li> Map allows markers to be dragged off-map which causes weird charts for non-existent latitudes.</li>

<li> If downloading source, I deliberately left out _key.jsp which holds the timeszonedb.com API key. That file should contain the
following: &lt;%! String timezoneDbKey="replace-with-key-here"; %&gt;
</li>

</ul>
